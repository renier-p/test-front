Please answer the following questions with your understanding. We want to know your
experience.

##
1. If you have a user requirement to create a new page what are the steps you take to
create the solution focusing on (UI,UX, FE)

##

###
    User research: Thanks to my experience in sales, the first step would be identifying needs to understand what the client truly wants and requires.

    User Experience Design (UX): I create wireframes to plan and get a clearer vision of how the page will look.

    User Interface Design (UI): I create a visual design aligned with the requirements specified in the project design.

    Front-End Development (FE): I build the HTML structure and components using JavaScript and React, and apply styles based on the chosen styling approach for the project.

3. What are some of the code best practices you use in your experience?
##

###
    Writing clean and modular code: I break down functions into reusable components that are easy to maintain.

    Comments and documentation: I comment on the code when the logic is complex, so other developers (or myself) can understand it in the future.

    Consistency in code style: I follow naming conventions, indentation, and code formatting to make it easy to read.

    Version control: I use Git to manage the code.

4. What are some ways to style components? Can you provide an explanation of each?
##

###
    External CSS: CSS files linked to the project. This makes it easier to reuse styles across multiple components and keeps the code clean.

    CSS Modules: Specific CSS files that generate uniquely named classes. These help prevent style conflicts.

    CSS-in-JS: Using libraries like Styled Components or Tailwind.

    Inline Styles: Styles applied directly to an element via the style attribute.

5. Describe 3 ways to pass information from a component to its parent component
##

###
    Functions as props: Pass a function from the parent component to the child, which, when executed, sends data back to the parent.

    Callback via custom events: Define a custom event in the child component that the parent component can listen for.

    Context API: Create a context that the parent can read, allowing child components to share data with higher levels without explicitly passing props.

6. Do you have experience in design systems? Can you please share your experience and
best practices?
##

###
    Yes, I have worked with design systems like Boostrap and Tailwind ,have collaborated in creating custom components following established style guides. In my experience:

    Consistency: I ensure that all components follow the same design and style rules.
    Componentization: I create reusable and modular components to make them easy to maintain and adjust.
